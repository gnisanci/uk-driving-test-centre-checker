It's hard to find an available UK driving test centre lot on a desired area. This little ruby program checks for them in the background and notifies you if a lot becomes available in the test centre.

Reqs:
=====
* Ruby and bundler must be installed
* Update the required values in code:

licence_no=''		  #e.g. 'JAMES123456J99XZ'   
test_ref_no=''		#e.g. '12345678'    
test_month=''  		#e.g. '/12/2017'   
test_location='' 	#e.g. 'N4'   

Usage:
=======
bundle install   
ruby driving.rb
